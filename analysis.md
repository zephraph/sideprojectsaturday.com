Based on my research, I've found the following about SwitchBot integration in the codebase:

## Summary of SwitchBot Implementation

### Current Implementation
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `SWITCHBOT_TOKEN`: API token for authentication
   - `SWITCHBOT_KEY`: Secret key for signing requests
   - `SWITCHBOT_DEVICE_ID`: The ID of the Bot device that controls the door

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/buzz` - POST endpoint that triggers the door opening
   - Uses the SwitchBot API v1.1 `/devices/{deviceId}/commands` endpoint
   - Sends a "press" command to activate the Bot device

3. **Authentication**:
   - Uses HMAC-SHA256 signature with token, timestamp, and nonce
   - Headers: Authorization, t (timestamp), nonce, sign

4. **Usage Locations**:
   - `src/pages/api/buzz.ts` - Direct API endpoint
   - `src/actions/index.ts` - Server action `openDoor`
   - `src/pages/buzz.astro` - User-facing page that auto-triggers door opening

### SwitchBot API v1.1 Device Status
According to the official documentation, there is a status endpoint available:
- **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.switch-bot.com/v1.1/devices/{deviceId}/status`
- **Authentication**: Same headers as command endpoint (Authorization, t, nonce, sign)
- **Purpose**: Returns current status of the device including battery level, power state, etc.

### Missing Functionality
Currently, there is no implementation that:
- Fetches the SwitchBot device status
- Displays device information (battery level, connection status, etc.)
- Shows any UI for monitoring the SwitchBot device health

This would be useful for administrators to monitor if the door control device is working properly, has sufficient battery, or is experiencing connectivity issues.

Based on my analysis of the admin dashboard structure, I can see the following patterns:

## Key Findings:

1. **Dashboard Structure**: The admin dashboard uses a card-based layout with:
   - A navbar at the top
   - Multiple card sections for different features (Event Management, Users)
   - Cards use DaisyUI classes (`card`, `card-body`, `card-title`)
   - Grid layout for sub-cards within sections

2. **Status Display Patterns**:
   - Status badges use DaisyUI badge classes (e.g., `badge badge-success`, `badge badge-error`)
   - Cards are used to group related functionality
   - The dashboard uses a consistent color scheme with `bg-base-100`, `bg-base-200` classes

3. **SwitchBot Integration**:
   - Currently only used in the buzz API endpoint
   - Has access to `SWITCHBOT_TOKEN`, `SWITCHBOT_KEY`, and `SWITCHBOT_DEVICE_ID`
   - Uses the SwitchBot API v1.1

## Recommended Location for SwitchBot Status UI:

The best place to add the SwitchBot status UI would be in the **Event Management Section** of the admin dashboard, as a new card alongside the existing event management cards. This makes sense because:

1. The door buzzer is directly related to event management
2. Admins would want to see the device status when managing events
3. It fits the existing card-based layout pattern

The UI should:
- Display the current status of the SwitchBot device (online/offline, battery level, etc.)
- Show the last successful buzz time
- Possibly include a manual test button for admins
- Use the same card styling and status badge patterns as the rest of the dashboard
