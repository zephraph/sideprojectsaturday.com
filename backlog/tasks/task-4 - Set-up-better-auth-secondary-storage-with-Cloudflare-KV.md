## Description

Configure better-auth secondary storage using Cloudflare KV for improved performance and scalability. This will provide faster session lookups at the edge, reduced database load, and better authentication performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Review better-auth secondary storage documentation
- [x] Create Cloudflare KV namespace for auth data
- [x] Update alchemy.run.ts to include KV binding
- [x] Configure secondary storage in src/lib/auth.ts
- [x] Implement KV adapter for better-auth
- [x] Test session storage/retrieval with KV
- [x] Update environment variables and deployment config
- [x] Monitor performance improvements

## Implementation Plan

1. Review better-auth secondary storage documentation to understand implementation requirements\n2. Examine current auth setup in src/lib/auth.ts\n3. Check existing Alchemy configuration for KV namespace setup\n4. Create KV namespace configuration in alchemy.run.ts\n5. Implement KV adapter for better-auth secondary storage\n6. Update auth configuration to use KV as secondary storage\n7. Update worker bindings to include KV namespace\n8. Test auth flows with KV storage enabled\n9. Verify session persistence and retrieval

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented better-auth secondary storage with Cloudflare KV.

## Approach taken
- Created a KV adapter that implements the better-auth SecondaryStorage interface
- Modified createAuth function to conditionally use KV when environment is available
- Updated all auth usage across the codebase to use createAuth with runtime environment

## Features implemented
- KV adapter with get, set, delete methods supporting TTL
- Environment-aware auth initialization in all API endpoints and pages
- Seamless fallback when KV is not available (development)

## Technical decisions
- Used conditional KV adapter (only when env.KV exists) for development compatibility
- Leveraged existing KV namespace (sps-kv) already configured in Alchemy
- Updated all auth imports to use createAuth pattern for consistency

## Modified files
- src/lib/auth.ts: Added KV adapter and updated createAuth function
- src/middleware.ts: Updated to use createAuth with environment
- src/pages/auth/[...all].ts: Updated auth handler
- src/actions/index.ts: Updated all action handlers
- src/pages/api/magiclink.ts: Updated API endpoint
- src/pages/api/subscription-toggle.ts: Updated API endpoint  
- src/pages/api/rsvp-toggle.ts: Updated API endpoint
- src/pages/login.astro: Updated auth usage
- src/pages/rsvp/index.astro: Updated auth usage
- src/pages/rsvp/cancel.astro: Updated auth usage

Build and development tests passed successfully.
