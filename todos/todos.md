# Todos

- Convert from cloudflare workflows and crons to using trigger.dev. `event-management.tsx` and `user-event-consumer.ts` should be moved to trigger functions. I've already got trigger.dev setup.
- Setup Resend webhook for email bounce and spam handling (Automatically handle email bounces and spam to maintain sender reputation)
- Add Sentry integration for error monitoring (Monitor and track production errors with proper alerting and debugging)
